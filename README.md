## Overview

This project analyzes the King County data set to answer the business case question of what types of housing features to pay attention to when buying and flipping homes in King county. Using the OSEMN data science process the housing features that would be the most lucrative for the Zillow-type company would be waterfront, grade, and zip codes beginning with 9811 and 9810. The company J.Hughes Inc. can use the information when deciding which houses to buy and flip and which houses to avoid investing in.
 
## Business Case
 
The budding Zillow-type company, J.Hughes Inc., is buying and flipping houses in the Seattle area. They would like to know the types of housing features to prioritize to make the most profit. Knowing which features have the biggest impact on housing prices, J. Hughes Inc. could then make data-driven decisions on which houses to purchase to optimize making a profit on.
 
## Data

The data used in this project is the King County housing dataset. The dataset provides data from houses sold between the years 2014 to 2015 with 21,597 entries which includes 21 features.
 
## Methods

This project used the OSEMN data science process. OSEMN stands for obtain, scrub, explore, model, and interpret. 
 
## Results

After running four linear regression models, the second model proved to have the best and most relevant results for the stakeholders. Specific housing features to pay attention to when purchasing and flipping homes were most notably waterfront, bathrooms, sqft. Living and several zip codes. The zipcodes that would be the most lucrative begin with the four digits of 9811, 9810, 9819, and 9812. Zip codes to avoid would then be the ones starting with the first four digits of 9809, 9818, 9802, and 9817. 
 
 
## Conclusions
I’d recommend the company, J.Hughes Inc., invest in houses that have a waterfront, add additional bathrooms when flipping the houses, and also buy homes that fall in the beginning four digits of 9811, 9810, 9819, and 9812.
